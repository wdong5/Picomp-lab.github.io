**Exploring Next-Generation AI for Scientific Discovery**
<p>
SciML is undergoing a paradigm shift with the advent of foundation models like AlphaFold-3, PanGu-&#x3A3;, and ClimaX, which are trained on extensive datasets using large-scale self-supervision and can be adapted to various downstream tasks. These general-purpose subject matter experts (SMEs) demonstrate superior accuracy compared to traditional specialized DNN models. For example, the new AlphaFold3 model demonstrates substantially higher performance in all but one category compared to previous DNN methods specializing in specific tasks. This paradigm shift is also being undertaken in other domains, such as Prithvi and GraphCast in climate science; DeepMind's GNN and ESM-1b in biology; Planck, WMAP, and Euclid in cosmology; and ChemBERTa, MatBERT, and ANI-1 in chemistry.
